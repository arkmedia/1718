							Little did Ray know that by &ldquo;never underestimating&rdquo; what he could do would make a difference for the Alyce and Elmore Kraemer Cancer Care Center of St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital. In January 2010, Ray generously contributed $20,060 to the center in memory of the love of his life,

							Wyleene Moser, who lost her battle with lung cancer in October 2009. Ray and &ldquo;Wy,&rdquo; as she was affectionately known, met when Ray asked her to dance the Blue Tango. They continued their love for dancing on a weekly basis for over 55 years.

							Ray&rsquo;s gift will benefit patients and families receiving care at the Cancer Care Center. It is a wonderful way to remember the life and love Ray and Wy shared. It is also a reminder that there are incredibly talented people in all walks of life who, when given the opportunity, choose to make a difference.
