							Alyce Kraemer was not one who sought recognition.  She simply and quietly enjoyed helping others and appreciated opportunities when she could give back to the community in which she lived for over 80 years.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 1998 at the age of 95, Mrs. Kraemer provided an anonymous gift of $2 Million on behalf of herself and her husband, Elmore Kraemer, to the cancer care center at what was then known as St. Joseph&rsquo;s Community Hospital.  It wasn&rsquo;t until she passed away in 2004, at the age of 101, that the anonymous donor&rsquo;s name was revealed along with her generous spirit.
						</p>
						<p>
							Mrs. Kraemer was a school teacher and taught Kindergarten in West Bend for six years in the 1920&rsquo;s.

						<p>
							Her classes included students who, generations later, were from families that continue to support the Kraemer Cancer Center and what has now become Froedtert Health St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital.
						</p>
						<p>
							Mrs. Kraemer enjoyed being able to see while she was still living how her donation benefitted others.  She provided the support she did out of the goodness of her heart and without the need to be recognized.  Not only was she a teacher by trade, but through her kindness and generosity she provided a true life lesson about giving back, and the importance of supporting the community in which you live and work.
